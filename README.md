## Installing Golang
1. Download Golang
   Visit the official [Golang Downloads Page](https://golang.org/dl/) and select the installer appropriate for your operating system:
   - Windows: `.msi` installer  
   - macOS: `.pkg` installer  
   - Linux: `.tar.gz` archive  

2. Install Golang
   - Windows/macOS:  
     Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. This will automatically configure Golang and set environment variables.  
   - Linux:  
     Extract the archive and move the files to `/usr/local`:  
     ```bash
     sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     ```  
     Add Golang to your `PATH` by appending this line to your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):  
     ```bash
     export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
     ```  
     Save the changes and reload your shell:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

3. Verify Installation
   Open a terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   go version
   ```  
   If Golang is installed correctly, the installed version will be displayed.
